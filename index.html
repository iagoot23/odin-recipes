            <h2>Quatro Queijos Pizza</h2>
              <a href="./recipes/pizza.html"><img src="./assets/images/main-pizza.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_self" width="300px" height="300px"></a>
            <p>This is a rich and creamy pizza variety very popular in Brazil. Unlike the traditional Italian version, the Brazilian adaptation typically features a base of tomato sauce topped with Mozzarella, Provolone, Parmesan, and Catupiry (a soft, distinctive Brazilian cream cheese). Some variations may substitute Catupiry or Parmesan for Gorgonzola to add a sharper flavor profile.</p>

            <h2>Tilápia à Milanesa</h2>
              <a href="./recipes/tilapia.html"><img src="./assets/images/main-tilapia.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_self" width="300px" height="300px"></a>
            <p>This popular Brazilian dish consists of fresh tilapia fillets seasoned with garlic, lime, and salt, then coated in a crisp layer of flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs. Deep-fried until golden brown, the result is a crunchy exterior that gives way to tender, flaky white fish. It is a favorite at coastal kiosks and family dinners, typically served with white rice, beans, and a fresh garden salad.</p>

            <a href="./recipes/brigadeiro.html"><img src="./assets/images/main-brigadeiro.png" rel="noreferrer" target="_self" width="300px" height="300px"></a>
            <p>The Brigadeiro is Brazil's most iconic sweet treat, often compared to a chocolate truffle or bonbon. It is made by simmering sweetened condensed milk, cocoa powder, and butter until the mixture thickens into a rich, fudge-like dough. Once cooled, it is traditionally rolled into bite-sized balls and coated in chocolate sprinkles. It is a staple at birthday parties and celebrations across the country.</p>
