            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Tilápia à Milanesa is a quintessential seafood dish in Brazil, favored for its light, flaky texture and the satisfying crunch of its golden-brown breading. Tilapia is an ideal choice for this preparation due to its mild flavor, which carries seasonings well without being overly "fishy." The fillets are typically marinated in a mixture of lime juice, garlic, salt, and pepper, then dredged through flour, beaten eggs, and breadcrumbs to create a protective shell that locks in moisture during the cooking process.<br>The result is a versatile protein that serves as a cornerstone of the Brazilian "Prato Feito" or as a popular "tira-gosto" in lakeside kiosks and bars. When fried to perfection, the exterior provides a crisp, savory contrast to the tender, white meat inside. It is traditionally served with a side of white rice, brown beans, and a fresh salad, often accompanied by lime wedges to add a bright, acidic zest that cuts through the richness of the fried coating.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Season the Fish:</strong> Place the tilapia fillets in a bowl and season them with lime juice, minced garlic, salt, and black pepper. Let them marinate for at least 15 to 30 minutes so the meat absorbs the flavors.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Breading Station:</strong> Set up three shallow bowls. Put all-purpose flour in the first, beaten eggs with a pinch of salt in the second, and breadcrumbs (or Panko for extra crunch) in the third.</li>
                <li><strong>Dredge in Flour:</strong> Take a fillet and coat it lightly in the flour, shaking off any excess. This helps the egg stick to the fish.</li>
                <li><strong>Dip in Egg:</strong> Submerge the floured fillet into the beaten eggs until it is completely covered.
                Coat with Breadcrumbs: Place the fillet into the breadcrumbs, pressing firmly on both sides to ensure the coating is even and secure.</li>
                <li><strong>Fry until Golden:</strong> Heat enough vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Carefully place the fillets in the hot oil and fry for about 3 to 4 minutes per side until they are golden brown and crispy.</li>
                <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong> Remove the fillets from the oil and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to remove excess fat. Serve immediately with fresh lime wedges.</li>
            </ol>
