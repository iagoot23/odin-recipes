            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Brigadeiro is a beloved Brazilian confection that holds a place of honor at nearly every national celebration, from casual get-togethers to elaborate birthday parties. Created in the 1940s and named after Brigadier Eduardo Gomes, this treat was born out of wartime creativity when fresh milk and sugar were scarce, leading cooks to rely on pantry staples like condensed milk. Today, it is more than just a dessert; it is a cultural icon that represents hospitality and the shared joy of Brazilian festivities.<br>The sensory appeal of a brigadeiro lies in its unique, fudgy texture—a perfect middle ground between a chocolate truffle and a soft caramel. Traditionally crafted by slow-cooking condensed milk, butter, and cocoa powder (or chocolate milk powder like Nescau), the mixture is stirred until it reaches a thick, velvety consistency that pulls away from the pan. Once cooled, it is hand-rolled into bite-sized spheres and coated in chocolate sprinkles, though modern gourmet versions often feature sophisticated toppings like crushed nuts, sea salt, or high-quality Belgian chocolate flakes.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Combine the Ingredients:</strong> In a small non-stick saucepan, mix one can of condensed milk, 1 tablespoon of butter, and 3 tablespoons of cocoa powder or chocolate milk powder.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the Mixture:</strong> Place the pan over low-to-medium heat. Stir constantly with a spatula to ensure the bottom does not burn.</li>
                <li><strong>Reach the "Ponto de Brigadeiro":</strong> Continue stirring for about 10 to 15 minutes. The mixture is ready when it thickens significantly and slides off the bottom of the pan in one mass when you tilt it.</li>
                <li><strong>Cool Down:</strong> Pour the mixture onto a greased plate or a shallow bowl. Let it cool completely at room temperature or in the refrigerator until it is firm enough to handle.</li>
                <li><strong>Roll the Balls:</strong> Lightly grease your hands with a tiny bit of butter. Scoop a small portion of the fudge and roll it between your palms to form a small sphere.</li>
                <li><strong>Coat and Serve:</strong> Roll each ball in a bowl of chocolate sprinkles until fully covered. Place them in small paper liners or serve them directly.</li>
