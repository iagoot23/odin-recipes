            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Quatro Queijos, or "Four Cheese" pizza, is a celebrated staple of Italian-inspired cuisine, known for its rich, decadent profile and harmonious blend of textures. While the specific selection of cheeses can vary by region or chef, the traditional composition typically features a balanced mix of creamy, salty, and pungent varieties. In Brazil, this often results in a combination of mozzarella for stretch, parmesan for a sharp salty finish, provolone for a touch of smokiness, and either gorgonzola or catupiry to provide a distinct creaminess that ties the flavors together.<br>The sensory experience of this pizza is defined by the way the different fats and proteins interact under high heat. As it bakes, the mozzarella creates a golden, bubbling foundation, while the more intense cheeses like gorgonzola melt into the crevices, offering sharp bursts of flavor. The result is a complex, savory palette that ranges from the mild, lactic notes of the base to the sophisticated, bold punch of the aged inclusions. Often finished with a sprinkle of dried oregano or a drizzle of olive oil, it remains a favorite for those who appreciate the depth and versatility of dairy.</p>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong> Stretch or roll out your pizza dough on a floured surface until it reaches your desired thickness. If you are using a pizza stone, preheat it in the oven at its highest temperature for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Apply the Base:</strong> Spread a thin, even layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving about 2 cm around the edges for the crust.</li>
                <li><strong>Layer the Cheeses:</strong> Distribute the mozzarella evenly as the first layer to ensure a consistent melt. Follow with the provolone and parmesan. Drop small dollops of gorgonzola or catupiry across the surface to create pockets of intense flavor.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake the Pizza:</strong> Place the pizza in the oven. Bake until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling and starting to develop golden spots. In a standard home oven at 250°C, this usually takes 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
                <li><strong>Finishing Touches:</strong> Remove the pizza from the oven and immediately sprinkle with dried oregano. Drizzle a little extra virgin olive oil over the top and add fresh basil leaves if desired.</li>
                <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong> Let the pizza rest for two minutes to allow the cheeses to set slightly before slicing.</li>
            </ol>
